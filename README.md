Basic Generative Model using Python and PyTorch
This project aims to build a basic generative model using Python and PyTorch. A generative model is a type of machine learning model that is trained to generate new data that is similar to a training dataset. It can be used for a wide range of applications, such as image generation, text generation, and even music generation.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python and PyTorch installed on your computer. You can install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and PyTorch from the PyTorch website (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Once you have Python and PyTorch installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/basic-generative-model.git
Usage
To use the generative model, you can run the generative_model.py script from the command line. This script allows you to specify various parameters such as the number of training iterations, learning rate, and batch size.

bash
Copy code
python generative_model.py --iterations 1000 --learning_rate 0.001 --batch_size 32
Contributing
